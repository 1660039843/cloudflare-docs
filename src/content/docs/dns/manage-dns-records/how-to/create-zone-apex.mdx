When you add a domain to Cloudflare, you may also need to create a DNS record on your zone apex (`example.com`).

To do this, create an [IP address resolution record](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/#ip-address-resolution) (`A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME`) using `@` for the **Name**, as in the following example.

<Example>

| Type | Name | IPv4 address | Proxy status |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ | ------------ |
| A    | `@`  | `192.0.2.1`  | Proxied      |

</Example>

<Tabs syncKey="dashPlusAPI">
<TabItem label="Dashboard">
1. Log in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select your account and zone.
2. Go to **DNS** > **Records** and select **Add record**.
3. Select `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` as the record **Type**, according to your needs:
    - If your hosting service has provided an IPv4 address, select `A`, use `@` for the record **Name**, and insert the IPv4 address in the respective field.
    - If your hosting service has provided an IPv6 address, select `AAAA`, use `@` for the record **Name**, and insert the IPv6 address in the respective field.
    - If your hosting service has provided a hostname (or a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)), select `CNAME`, use `@` for the record **Name**, and insert the hostname in the **Target** field.
4. Specify the **Proxy status** and **TTL** according to your needs.
5. Select **Save** to confirm.

<TabItem label="API">
Use the [Create DNS Record API endpoint](/api/operations/dns-records-for-a-zone-create-dns-record).
<Render file="api-field-definitions" />
    - If your hosting service has provided an IPv4 address, select **A Record**, use `@` for the field `name`, and use the IPv4 address for the field `content`.
    - If your hosting service has provided an IPv6 address, select **AAAA Record**, use `@` for the field `name`, and use the IPv6 address for the field `content`.
    - If your hosting service has provided a hostname (or a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)), select **CNAME Record**, use `@` for the field `name`, and use the hostname for the field `content`.

## Domain redirects

Once you create a domain, you may want to route that traffic to other places.

For more guidance, refer to [Redirect domain to subdomain](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/manage-subdomains/#redirect-the-apex-domain-to-a-subdomain) or [Redirect one domain to another](/fundamentals/setup/manage-domains/redirect-domain/).

## Get free SSL certificates

Cloudflare offers free, unshared, publicy trusted [Universal SSL certificates](/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/) to all Cloudflare domains.
